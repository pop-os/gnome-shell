Subject: main: Avoid meta finalize

This is a workaround to maintain a clean environment for gnome-shell
and particularly JavaScript/GJS to shutdown without crashing.

The main cause of shutdown crashes is _shell_global_destroy_gjs_context
needing Clutter/Cogl resources to clean up, when those resources have
already been destroyed by meta_finalize in meta_run. So by never calling
meta_finalize via meta_run, we can simply avoid all those ordering
conflicts that cause so many crashes.

Proper fixes will eventually come upstream when these are finished or
replaced by something else:

https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-shell/-/merge_requests/1759
https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-shell/-/merge_requests/648

Given that, and upstream's usual preference for proper permanent fixes,
this will not be forwarded.
