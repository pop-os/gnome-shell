Subject: Revert "st: Apply css foreground color to text as a PangoAttribute"

Using the pango foreground color implies that such part will have a
color set at pango level and so that cogl will use this value as a
color override (as per cogl_pango_renderer_set_color_for_part()).

This is fine for most labels, but in case the clutter-text has the
selected text color set, it is simply ignored, because the overridden
color is always preferred.

Also the reason for this commit, was not to apply colors on top of
colored fonts, but this won't happen anymore now because mutter's commit
aa136f45 ensures that no color will be applied to glyphs that are
already colored.

So to me it looks that's just safer to revert it, instead of adding
different logic to handle the selected-text-color case.

This reverts commit 66c4b1a8b607600f193b34e6a9f8c85f76c2ac2c.
